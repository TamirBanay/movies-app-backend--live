**Movie Explorer App**

Description:
My Movie Explorer App is a small React project that I developed for self-practice. It's a web application that allows me to explore a curated list of movies, view detailed information about each movie, and search for specific films. The project primarily focuses on improving my skills in React, including state management, routing, and making API requests from(TMDb).

1. Movie Listing

   - The app displays a list of currently playing movies, fetched from TMDb's database.
   - Users can navigate through multiple pages of movie listings.

2. Movie Details

   - Clicking on a movie card reveals detailed information about the selected movie.
   - Information includes the movie title, release date, rating, poster, and a brief overview.

3. Responsive Design
   - The app is designed to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
